"Addressing the Urbanisation and Population Crisis in Pakistan using Big Data Analytics"

The following research aims to investigate the population and urbanisation crisis in Pakistan. The 
research was conducted to investigate the factors that influence in the urbanisation and population 
increase within a few districts in Pakistan. The past research papers mostly focus on the issues 
caused by overpopulation and there is little to no research as to why there are only a handful of 
districts that constitute a large portion of population. The research aims to explore the key 
variables driving the rapid increase in population and urbanisation in Pakistan by discussing 
unfair distribution of population and urban areas across the country. Increase in Urbanisation and 
population are not harmful if they are fairly distributed across the country which is not the case 
in current research topic. Data collected from different sources was joined together to perform 
analysis and create a machine learning model which helps identifying variables that are most 
influential towards the research problems. 

Majority of the data was collected from Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and Al-Hasan Systems.
